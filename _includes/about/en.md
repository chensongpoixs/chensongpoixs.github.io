I am a northbound drifter. Like most northbound drifters, I travel for a living. I take the subway for more than an hour in the morning and work overtime frequently.

A man still on the road, yearning for freedom and dreams!

This is my notes on my regular study and work.

If you have any questions, you are welcome to discuss them.~ ^_^
